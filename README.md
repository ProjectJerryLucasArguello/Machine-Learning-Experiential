<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>
Today is 8/9/25 and I just started my journey in machine learning and AI and whatever is big with tech. With AI being popular it can become scary with the unknown and how it's running rampant recently.
So far this project just highlight how diffcult it is. I was able to use the numpy, pandas, and seaborn to represent data, which is a pro. It just the data. Or rather how to clean it. Cause you'll see in the data how... bad it looks.
I need to work on the way I clean data in order to make good predictions. Cause qwhat's good with all that data if it's just random numbers and values!
